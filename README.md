Welcome to Growa!
At Growa, we are committed to tackling the intertwined challenges of gender inequality and climate change through innovative solutions and data-driven insights. Our initiative recognizes that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a vital framework for fostering peace and prosperity for both people and the planet.

As climate change intensifies, marginalized communities—especially gender minorities—face heightened vulnerabilities, leading to a “crisis layered on top of a crisis.” We believe that addressing these interconnected issues is not only crucial for achieving sustainable development but also for building stronger, more equitable communities.

Our Mission
Our challenge is to utilize open-source data on gender inequality and climate change to model their relationship and propose actionable solutions that promote both gender equity and climate action.

Objectives
Data Analysis: Investigate how climate change affects marginalized groups through a macro or localized approach.
Model Development: Create models that illustrate the gendered impacts of climate change and highlight the importance of addressing these issues together.
Solution Proposals: Develop innovative solutions, whether through interactive dashboards, informative websites, or community-specific climate mitigation plans.
Key Considerations
We consider technology to be the main driver of change in any society, and we believe it can be adapted to improve people's lives. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary analysis and the integration of social sciences are essential, enabling us not only to innovate technologically but also socially.

Proposed Solutions
Implement projects based on circular economy principles to promote sustainability.

Integrate social analysis with statistical and programming analysis to create a more holistic understanding of the issues at hand.

Delve into the social and economic impacts of climate change on gender equality.

Utilize resources like NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for valuable data.

Be aware of algorithmic biases in data analysis and strive to represent the stories that often go untold.

Engage with the knowledge and expertise of the communities you study, recognizing their traditional practices and perspectives.

Join us on this journey to create meaningful change at the intersection of gender equity and climate action.
